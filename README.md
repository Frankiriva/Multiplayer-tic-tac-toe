A Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++ based on the client-server model using the basics of socket programming.

Currently the source codes have been compiled for Linux systems. Here's what the server(Player 1) needs to do to set up a game :

./server.out    
server.out is the compiled output file for creating the server.                                                                             

The client(Player 2) should type in -

./client.out 192.0.2.80

client.out is the compiled output file for connecting to the server and 192.0.2.80 is the IP address of the server(say). Given a server has already been set up, the client should be able to connect comfortably to the server.

Feel free to report any bugs by mail. Suggestions are welcome.
